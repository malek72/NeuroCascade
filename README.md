# NeuroCascade
NeuroCascade leverages deep learning to integrate EEG features—phase, amplitude, PPC, PAC—for enhanced diagnosis of neurological disorders. The project includes EEG denoising, comprehensive feature extraction, and state-of-the-art model construction to uncover brain encoding mechanisms and discover novel biomarkers.
